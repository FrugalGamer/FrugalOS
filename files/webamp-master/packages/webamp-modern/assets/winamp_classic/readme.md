Winamp Classic Modernized
=========================

Creating winamp skin is a complex task.

here some that come to my brain:
* Bitmaps name should reflect to winamp classic bitmap filename, when possible
* Provide several xml that can be switched by bitmap existence
* Instead of few files (with too large lines), lets split them into managable code,
  (Winamp Modern did, please follow)
* Maximize using of xml tags & attributes as possible, rather than creating new maki script
