# Winamp Skin Database

This package contains code for managing the collection of Winamp skins which are used for various projects related to [Webamp](https://webamp.org):

- [@winampSkins](https://twitter.com/winampskins) Twitter Bot
- The Discord bot used in the Webamp Discord

## Discord Bot

The discord bot allows us to:

- Review skins for use by the Twitter bot
- Upload new skins to the database
- Get a screenshot of a given skin
- Get a link/screenshot of a skin based on its hash

## Server

This package also includes a GraphQL interface for exploring skins. It is not currently used by anything, but can be useful for inspecting the data.
