// This is a temporary module intended to collect all the places where the demo
// site reaches out into Webamp code. The goal is to eventually have the demo
// site consume the actual Webamp NPM module, so hopefully this module can go
// away once we've figured out how to expose all the things that the demo site
// needs, or reduce the things that the demo site needs access to.
