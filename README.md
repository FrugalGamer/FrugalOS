# FrugalOS
Combination art project and coding practice. This is my attempt to create an online workspace that is as static and open and possible, using plain HTML, CSS, and javascript. I have included Jquery, mostly because it automates several low-level things and can make things much faster, but other than that I'm trying to use a few plugins as possible.
